## 📖 Guide Structure

Each cultivation guide contains **9 comprehensive sections**:

### 1. Climate Requirements 🌡️
- Optimal temperature ranges
- Best growing seasons
- Climate zone suitability
- Frost/heat tolerance levels
- Special climate needs

**Example** (from Watermelon):
```
Temperature: 25-35°C optimal, warm season crop
Season: Summer (Jan-Mar) and Rainy (Jun-Jul) seasons
Requires hot, dry weather during fruiting for sweetness
Sensitive to frost and excessive rainfall during maturity
```

### 2. Soil Requirements 🌱
- Preferred soil types
- pH range requirements
- Drainage specifications
- Organic matter needs
- Soil preparation tips

**Example** (from Strawberry):
```
Type: Well-drained sandy loam to loamy soils
pH: 5.5-6.5 (slightly acidic preferred)
Drainage: Excellent drainage mandatory, raised beds essential
Organic Matter: Very high organic content required
```

### 3. Water Management 💧
- Irrigation frequency
- Critical watering stages
- Total water requirements (mm)
- Drought tolerance
- Waterlogging sensitivity

**Example** (from Millet):
```
Irrigation: Requires only 2-3 irrigations in entire season
Critical Stages: Flowering and grain filling stages
Total Water Requirement: 350-400mm for entire crop
Highly drought-resistant, ideal for rain-fed conditions
```

### 4. Planting Details 🌱
- Optimal planting seasons
- Seed rate (kg/hectare)
- Row and plant spacing
- Planting depth
- Growing period duration
- Transplanting details (if applicable)

**Example** (from Tomato):
```
Nursery Season: June-July for monsoon crop, September-October for winter
Transplanting: 25-30 days after sowing when 4-5 true leaves appear
Plant Spacing: 75cm x 60cm or 60cm x 45cm
Seedling Depth: Plant slightly deeper than nursery depth
Growing Period: 60-90 days from transplanting to first harvest
```

### 5. Fertilizer Requirements 🌿
- NPK ratios (kg/hectare)
- FYM (Farmyard Manure) quantities
- Split application schedule
- Micronutrient requirements
- Organic alternatives
- Special notes for specific crops

**Example** (from Sugarcane):
```
NPK: 250:115:115 kg/hectare for plant crop
Ratoon: 340:170:170 kg/hectare
Apply 25-30 tonnes FYM/hectare at land preparation
Nitrogen in 3 splits: 25% basal, 50% at 45 days, 25% at 90 days
Biofertilizers (Azospirillum, PSB) recommended
```

### 6. Best Practices ✅
**7-8 actionable tips** with checkmarks for easy reference:
- Seed selection and treatment
- Land preparation techniques
- Pest and disease prevention
- Irrigation management
- Weed control strategies
- Harvesting guidelines
- Post-harvest handling
- Storage recommendations
- Crop rotation suggestions

**Example** (from Pepper/Bell Pepper):
```
✓ Use healthy seedlings from disease-free nursery
✓ Transplant in evening hours to reduce shock
✓ Mulch with plastic or organic materials
✓ Provide staking support to prevent lodging
✓ Remove first few flowers for better plant establishment
✓ Control thrips and aphids early
✓ Harvest when fruits reach full size and desired color
✓ Regular picking encourages more fruiting
```

### 7. Expected Yield 📊
- Average yield (quintals/hectare or tonnes/hectare)
- Good management practices yield
- Optimal conditions yield
- Regional variations
- Comparison with national averages

**Example** (from Strawberry):
```
Average: 100-150 quintals/hectare
Good Management: 200-300 quintals/hectare
Protected Cultivation: 400-600 quintals/hectare
```

### 8. Common Issues ⚠️
**3 major problems** with detailed causes and solutions:
- Pest infestations
- Disease outbreaks
- Nutrient deficiencies
- Environmental stress
- Management errors

**Example** (from Pomegranate):
```
• Bacterial Blight: Black spots on leaves and fruits (copper sprays)
• Fruit Borer: Larvae bore into fruits (pheromone traps and insecticides)
• Fruit Cracking: Irregular irrigation (maintain consistent moisture)
```

### 9. Regional Considerations 🗺️
- Climate zone adaptability
- Seasonal variations by region
- Regional best practices
- Local variety recommendations

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### File Structure
```
agrisense_app/backend/
├── chatbot_qa_pairs.json          # Main knowledge base (4,143 answers)
├── chatbot_service.py             # Retrieval and processing engine
├── chatbot_index.json             # Search index
├── chatbot_index.npz              # Vector embeddings
└── main.py                        # API endpoints
```

#### API Endpoints

**1. Chat Endpoint (Frontend)**
```python
POST /chatbot/ask
Content-Type: application/json

Request:
{
  "question": "tell me about watermelon cultivation"
}

Response:
{
  "answer": "🍉 **Watermelon Cultivation Guide**\r\n\r\n**Climate Requirements:**...",
  "source": "AgriGuide"
}
```

**2. Internal Chat Endpoint (Legacy)**
```python
POST /chat/ask
Content-Type: application/json

Request:
{
  "question": "how to grow tomato"
}

Response:
{
  "answer": "🍅 **Tomato Cultivation Guide**\r\n\r\n**Climate Requirements:**...",
  "source": "AgriGuide"
}
```

#### Crop Name Detection Logic

**Simple Crop Name Queries**
```python
# User inputs just crop name
Input: "watermelon"
Process: _is_simple_crop_name_query() → True
Output: "Watermelon"
```

**Detailed Cultivation Queries**
```python
# User asks about cultivation
Input: "tell me about watermelon cultivation"
Process: _get_crop_cultivation_guide("watermelon")
Output: [Full 800-1200 character guide]
```

**Normalized Crop Names**
```python
# Handles aliases and variations
"maize" → "corn"
"brinjal" → "eggplant"
"lady finger" → "okra"
"red chilli" → "chili"
"bell pepper" → "pepper"
```

### Data Format

#### JSON Structure
```json
{
  "questions": [
    "What is the best temperature for tomato cultivation?",
    "How to grow watermelon?",
    ...
  ],
  "answers": [
    "🍅 **Tomato Cultivation Guide**\r\n\r\n**Climate Requirements:**\r\n• Temperature: 20-25°C optimal...",
    "🍉 **Watermelon Cultivation Guide**\r\n\r\n**Climate Requirements:**\r\n• Temperature: 25-35°C optimal...",
    ...
  ],
  "sources": [
    "AgriGuide",
    "AgriGuide",
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Text Formatting
- **Emoji Prefixes**: Each guide starts with relevant crop emoji
- **Markdown**: Bold headers (`**`), bullet points (`•`), checkmarks (`✓`)
- **Line Breaks**: `\r\n` for JSON compatibility
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with `ensure_ascii=False` for special characters

### Implementation Scripts

#### Batch Processing Approach
```python
# Four scripts created for systematic addition
add_crop_guides_batch1.py  # Crops 1-10 (Apple → Cotton)
add_crop_guides_batch2.py  # Crops 11-20 (Cucumber → Mango)
add_crop_guides_batch3.py  # Crops 21-30 (Millet → Radish)
add_crop_guides_batch4.py  # Crops 31-40 (Rapeseed → Watermelon)
```

#### Script Features
```python
import json

# 1. Load existing knowledge base
with open('agrisense_app/backend/chatbot_qa_pairs.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# 2. Prepare batch guides
batch_guides = [
    "🥕 **Carrot Cultivation Guide**\r\n\r\n...",
    "🍅 **Tomato Cultivation Guide**\r\n\r\n...",
    ...
]

# 3. Extend knowledge base
data['answers'].extend(batch_guides)
data['sources'].extend(["AgriGuide"] * len(batch_guides))

# 4. Save with proper formatting
with open('agrisense_app/backend/chatbot_qa_pairs.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
```
