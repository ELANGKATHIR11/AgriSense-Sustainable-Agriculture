What are the common symptoms of powdery mildew in crops?,"Powdery mildew appears as white, powdery spots on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. Early symptoms include small white spots that gradually spread, covering larger areas. Leaves may turn yellow and fall off. The disease thrives in warm, dry conditions with high humidity.",disease_identification,general,medium,,,
How can I prevent bacterial blight in my tomato plants?,"To prevent bacterial blight: 1) Use disease-resistant varieties, 2) Avoid overhead watering, 3) Provide good air circulation, 4) Remove infected plant debris, 5) Apply copper-based fungicides preventively, 6) Rotate crops annually, 7) Avoid working with wet plants.",disease_prevention,tomato,high,,,
What is the best treatment for leaf spot diseases?,"For leaf spot diseases: 1) Remove affected leaves immediately, 2) Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper, 3) Improve air circulation, 4) Water at soil level, not on leaves, 5) Apply mulch to prevent soil splash, 6) Use disease-resistant varieties in future plantings.",disease_treatment,general,medium,,,
How do I identify rust disease in wheat?,"Rust diseases in wheat appear as orange to reddish-brown pustules on leaves, stems, or heads. There are three main types: leaf rust (orange pustules on leaves), stem rust (reddish-brown pustules on stems), and stripe rust (yellow stripes on leaves). Early detection is crucial for management.",disease_identification,wheat,high,,,
What causes yellowing of crop leaves?,"Leaf yellowing can be caused by: 1) Nutrient deficiency (especially nitrogen), 2) Overwatering or poor drainage, 3) Viral infections, 4) Natural aging, 5) Pest damage, 6) Herbicide injury, 7) Root problems. Proper diagnosis requires examining the pattern of yellowing and other symptoms.",disease_identification,general,low,,,
What are the most effective methods for controlling broadleaf weeds?,"Broadleaf weed control methods: 1) Selective herbicides (2,4-D, dicamba), 2) Hand removal when young, 3) Dense crop planting to compete, 4) Cover crops, 5) Mulching, 6) Cultivating between rows, 7) Pre-emergent herbicides. Timing is crucial for effectiveness.",weed_control,,,broadleaf,integrated,
How can I prevent grassy weeds in my corn field?,"For grassy weed prevention in corn: 1) Use pre-emergent herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor), 2) Plant cover crops like rye, 3) Maintain proper crop density, 4) Rotate with broadleaf crops, 5) Cultivate when weeds are small, 6) Use herbicide-resistant corn varieties, 7) Scout fields regularly.",weed_prevention,corn,,grassy,,
What is the economic threshold for weed control?,"Economic threshold for weed control is the weed density at which the cost of control equals the value of crop loss prevented. Generally: 1-2 weeds per square foot for most crops. Consider: control cost, crop value, yield loss potential, weed competitiveness, and long-term weed seed production.",weed_economics,,,general,economic,
How do I identify herbicide-resistant weeds?,"Signs of herbicide resistance: 1) Weeds survive recommended herbicide rates, 2) Uneven control patterns in field, 3) Same weed species surviving multiple applications, 4) Poor control with previously effective herbicides. Confirm with bioassays and implement resistance management strategies immediately.",weed_identification,,,resistant,resistance_management,
What are cultural practices for weed management?,"Cultural weed management practices: 1) Crop rotation to break weed cycles, 2) Competitive crop varieties, 3) Optimal planting dates, 4) Proper plant spacing, 5) Cover crops, 6) Mulching, 7) Cultivation timing, 8) Fertilizer placement to favor crops, 9) Water management.",weed_control,,,general,cultural,
How do diseases and weeds interact in crop fields?,"Disease-weed interactions: 1) Weeds can harbor disease pathogens, 2) Dense weeds create humid conditions favoring diseases, 3) Weed stress can make crops more susceptible to diseases, 4) Some weeds compete with pathogens for nutrients, 5) Herbicide injury can increase disease susceptibility.",integrated_management,,,,,disease_weed_interaction
What is Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for plant health?,"IPM combines multiple strategies: 1) Regular monitoring and scouting, 2) Economic thresholds for treatment decisions, 3) Cultural practices (rotation, resistant varieties), 4) Biological control agents, 5) Targeted pesticide use, 6) Habitat management, 7) Record keeping for adaptive management.",integrated_management,,,,,ipm_strategy
How can I optimize my plant health monitoring schedule?,"Optimal monitoring schedule: 1) Weekly scouting during growing season, 2) Critical periods: emergence, flowering, grain fill, 3) Focus on field edges and problem areas, 4) Use weather data to predict disease pressure, 5) Monitor after herbicide applications, 6) Document findings with photos and GPS.",monitoring,,,,,scheduling
